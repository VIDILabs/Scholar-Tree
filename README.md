# Scholar-Tree-Docker

This is a fork of tlfung0219 *ScholarTree* project. I upgraded it to run through docker to improve compatibility. To run, make sure you have the latest docker and docker-compose version installed on your system. Minimum compatibility has to be with docker-compose version 3.8.

To run, execute `docker-compose up -d` for both containers to build and execute in the background. If you have questions, feel free to contact me (lukasmaxim).
